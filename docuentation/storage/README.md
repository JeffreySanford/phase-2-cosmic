# Storage — Phase 2 Real-World Specification

This folder contains storage-specific Phase 2 documentation: an executive summary, architectural diagrams, tiered lifecycle descriptions, governance integration, and deployment guidance for a hybrid, tiered, federated storage system designed for exascale radio astronomy data.

Files:

- STORAGE_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md — verbose executive summary and analysis

- STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md — architecture diagrams and system overview

- STORAGE_TIERS.md — detailed tier descriptions and lifecycle

- STORAGE_GOVERNANCE.md — governance, metadata, and catalog integration

- STORAGE_DEPLOYMENT.md — deployment, compute-near-data and operational guidance

Use these documents as the canonical starting point for storage design reviews, procurement, and integration planning.
